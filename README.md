## Cat's 'Rogue like game'
A take on the old school traditional Rogue game where Rogue is an @ symbol - use arrow keys to move
around the screen and keep away from the killer 'K' bosses!

Incorporating React hooks, an input manager and more.

Game Set Up
===========
- Create a board to play on
- Create a player
- Give the player the "Rogue" them - ie '@' symbol
- Set up a dungeon world for the game - randomly generated used rot.js which is a cool library - rot sets up a randomGen dungeon.
- Set collision of player when hitting walls or going off the board.
- Add Monsters (entities) Bugsy (entities) apples n pears (entities because it's just cooler!)

Here is a screenshot just after dungeon and player are set up and ready to rock around the world!
